# Study Helper
Little tool I whipped up in around 20 minutes to help me study.
# Configuration Files (plac in the 'cards' folder).
```js
// Blank lines & comments are ignored.

// Any line with a question and answer is delimited by " : ". including the spaces.
QUESTION1 : ANSWER

// All questions are read in order (for the time being).
```
# How To Build:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/linuxnoodle/study-helper
cd study-helper
make
```
